# Updates

Assumes that there are 8 files in the [SF_Account_Info](../Login_Credentials/SF_Account_Info.txt) file.

Takes the 8th file and updates all of the tables accordingly, including the predictions and the Dashboard.

The only difference between this notebook and the initial upload is that the SQL statements are different for creating the Total tables from the Excel sheets.

## Make sure to reopen the [PBI_Dashboard.pbix](../PBI_Dashboard/PBI_Dashboard.pbix) and click on `Update`!
